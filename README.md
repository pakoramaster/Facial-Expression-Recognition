# Facial Expression Recognition System Development

## Executive Summary
Facial expression recognition plays a very crucial role in various fields, such as mental health assessment and human-computer interaction. In this project, we will strive to develop a facial expression recognition system using convolutional neural networks. Our objective is to accurately identify distinct facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., with the use of various images as a dataset.

## Problem Definition and Motivation
The problem being defined is the recognition of facial expressions. As we know, automated facial expression recognition systems have applications in many fields, like emotions, human-computer interaction, market research, and mental health diagnosis. However, building an accurate FER system has several challenges, such as variations in lighting conditions and diverse facial expressions. The motivation for doing this project is the potential societal impact and technological advancements that have occurred in deep learning. Hence, our project aims to create an efficient and reliable FER system.

## Proposed Solution, Methods, and Objectives
We want to make a system that can understand facial expressions using a special kind of computer program, CNN. This program will be made of layers that work together to learn about faces and expressions. First, there will be layers that look at different parts of the face to understand what's there. Then, there will be layers that help pick out the most important parts. Finally, there will be layers that put all that information together to figure out what expression the person is showing.

## Data Source
We will utilize one of the publicly available facial expression datasets, such as FER2013, CK+, or RAF-DB, which contain labeled facial images with annotated expressions. These datasets provide a diverse range of facial expressions captured under different conditions, ensuring robust model training and evaluation.

## Measure of Success
The success of our project will be measured based on the accuracy and robustness of the developed facial expression recognition system. We will evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, we will conduct qualitative analysis to assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen facial expressions and variations.

## Detailed Project Plan
### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collect facial expression datasets (FER2013, CK+, or RAF-DB).
- Preprocess images (resize, normalization, augmentation).

### Phase 2: Model Development and Training
- Design and implement CNN architectures (e.g., CNN, ResNet, VGG).
- Train CNN models on the preprocessed dataset.

### Phase 3: Evaluation and Fine-tuning
- Evaluate model performance using the test dataset.
- Fine-tune pre-trained models using transfer learning.
- Compare and analyze results to select the best-performing model.

## Deliverables
- CNN from Scratch

## Application Areas
The developed facial expression recognition system has broad applications, including:
- Human-computer interaction
- Emotion-aware virtual agents
- Mental health assessment and therapy
- Market research and consumer behavior analysis
